# Every if-statement must have an else
# If this else should never run because it doesn't make sense then you must use
# a die function in the else that prints out an error message and dies. This
# will find many errors.
# Never nest if-statements more than two deep, and always try to do them one deep
# Treat if-statements like paragraphs. Where each if-elsif-else grouping is like
# a set of sentences. Put blank lines before and after.
# Your boolean tests should be simple. If they are complex, move their calculations
# to variables earlier in your function, and use good names for the variable.
